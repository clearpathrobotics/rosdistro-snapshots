# rosdistro-snapshots

This repo is part of a larger demonstration of Clearpath's effort to build
and deploy ROS packages using Nix, and has been prepared and released
publicly as part of a ROSCon talk given in Kyoto, in October 2022.

The repo houses a GitHub Action which creates daily snapshot tags of the devel
sources in https://github.com/ros/rosdistro, as well as those snapshots
themselves.

The latest one can be found in the orphan `snapshot/latest` branch.

To follow the self-guided demonstration and find links to other related
resources, please see the main repository:
